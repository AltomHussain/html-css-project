            The grapefruit is a subtropical citrus tree known for its relatively
            large sour to semi-sweet, somewhat bitter fruit. Grapefruit is a
            citrus hybrid originating in Barbados as an accidental cross between
            the sweet orange and pomelo, both of which were introduced from Asia
            in the seventeenth century. The grapefruit (Citrus × paradisi) is a
            subtropical citrus tree known for its relatively large sour to
            semi-sweet, somewhat bitter fruit. Grapefruit is a citrus hybrid
            originating in Barbados as an accidental cross between two
            introduced species – sweet orange (C. sinensis), and pomelo (or
            shaddock) (C. maxima) – both of which were introduced from Asia in
            the seventeenth century. When found, it was nicknamed the “forbidden
            fruit”. Frequently, it is misidentified as the very similar parent
            species, pomelo. The grape part of the name alludes to clusters of
            fruit on the tree that often appear similar to grape clusters

          <h2>Pineapple</h2>

            The pineapple is a tropical plant with an edible fruit, also called
            a pineapple, and the most economically significant plant in the
            family Bromeliaceae. The pineapple is indigenous to South America,
            where it has been cultivated for many centuries. Their nutrients and
            compounds have been linked to impressive health benefits, including
            improved digestion, a lower risk of cancer, improved immunity,
            relief of arthritis symptoms and improved recovery after surgery and
            strenuous exercise. The bromelain in pineapples may reduce the
            inflammation, swelling, bruising and pain that occurs after surgery.
            Bromelain’s anti-inflammatory properties may also aid recovery after
            strenuous exercise by reducing tissue inflammation. Eating
            pineapples may reduce the time it takes to recover from surgery or
            exercise.

          <h2>Avocado</h2>
          <img

            The Hass and Fuerte avocados are the two main varieties sold in the
            UK. The Hass avocado hails from Guatemala and has a dark
            purple/brown, pebbled, slightly rough, thicker skin. The Hass
            avocado is oval in shape. In contrast the Fuerte avocado, from
            Mexico has a thin, smooth, brighter green skin. It contains less
            oil, making it less creamy. The thin skin of the Fuerte is less
            robust and so often picked under ripe to prevent becoming damaged in
            transport. As a result Fuerte avocados take longer to ripen – and
            sometimes don’t – so Hass avocados are often the better bet.
            Avocados are native to Central and South America and did not appear
            in the UK until the mid-1900s. They are now commercially produced in
            the US, Caribbean, Mexico, Brazil, Israel and Australia. Sadly the
            climate restricts avocados growing in the UK.

        <h2>Fruits</h2>
        <p>
          In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants
          (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering.
          Fruits are the means by which angiosperms disseminate seeds. Edible
          fruits, in particular, have propagated with the movements of humans
          and animals in a symbiotic relationship as a means for seed dispersal
          and nutrition; in fact, humans and many animals have become dependent
          on fruits as a source of food.[1] Accordingly, fruits account for a
          substantial fraction of the world's agricultural output, and some
          (such as the apple and the pomegranate) have acquired extensive
          cultural and symbolic meanings. In common language usage, "fruit"
          normally means the fleshy seed-associated structures of a plant that
          are sweet or sour, and edible in the raw state, such as apples,
          bananas, grapes, lemons, oranges, and strawberries. On the other hand,
          in botanical usage, "fruit" includes many structures that are not
          commonly called "fruits", such as bean pods, corn kernels, tomatoes,
          and wheat grains.[2][3] The section of a fungus that produces spores
          is also called a fruiting body.
