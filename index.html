      <h2 id="head">London</h2>
      <p>London is famous for more than its magnificent ancient buildings,</br> the Palace of Westminster, Trafalgar Square, 
           Tower of London, London Eye, Art Galleries, and Big Ben.
           As the capital of Britain,</br> London is well known for influencing other cities of the world since the Middle Ages. </p>
           <p>The present-day City of London covers an area of 1.1 square miles (2.9 square km) at the heart of Greater London 
               and is a centre of world finance.</br> Greater London forms the core of a larger metropolitan area (with a proportionately</br> 
               larger population) that extends as far as 45 miles (70 km) from the centre.

        <h2>Manchester</h2>
        <p>Manchester is a major city in the northwest </br>of England with a rich industrial heritage.  
            The Castlefield conservation area’s </br>18th-century canal system recalls the city’s days as a textile powerhouse, 
            and visitors can trace this history at the interactive Museum of Science & Industry.
             The revitalised Salford Quays</br> dockyards now house the Daniel Libeskind-designed </br>Imperial War Museum North and the Lowry cultural centre.</p>
       
             <p>Manchester may be seen by many as being one of the most famous </br>football cities in the world, with it being the home to two of the biggest teams, 
               </br>  Manchester City and Manchester United.</br> However, the city is also credited with the founding of the world’s first professional football league.
               </br> In 1888, the founding Football League was set up at the Royal Hotel, </br>and it originally ran from the autumn of 1888 until the spring of 1889. 
                Twelve member clubs from the Midlands and North of England all competed in the </br>first league, including Bolton Wanderers, Aston Villa and Everton.
