          <p class="card-text">London is famous for more than its magnificent ancient buildings,</br> the Palace of Westminster, Trafalgar Square, 
            Tower of London, London Eye, Art Galleries, and Big Ben.
            As the capital of Britain,</br> London is well known for influencing other cities of the world since the Middle Ages. <br>
            The present-day City of London covers an area of 1.1 square miles (2.9 square km) at the heart of Greater London 
             and is a centre of world finance.</br> Greater London forms the core of a larger metropolitan area (with a proportionately</br> 
             larger population) that extends as far as 45 miles (70 km) from the centre.</p>

          <p class="card-text">Out of all of the cities in Europe,</br> Birmingham is the youngest with under 25s accounting 
            for nearly 40% of its population.
             Birmingham also holds the honours for having one of the highest graduate</br> 
             retention rates in Europe and over the last ten years,
             Birmingham's population has increased by more than 300,000 people 
             Birmingham is a major city in England’s West Midlands region,

          <h5 class="card-title">Glasgow </h5>
          <p class="card-text">Glasgow is a port city on the River Clyde in Scotland's western Lowlands. </br>It's famed for its Victorian and art nouveau architecture,
          </br> a rich legacy of the city's 18th–20th-century prosperity due to trade and shipbuilding.</br> Today it's a national cultural hub, </br>
           home to institutions including the Scottish Opera,</br>
          Scottish Ballet and National Theatre of Scotland, </br>as well as acclaimed museums and a thriving music scene.    
          Glasgow is also known for the Glasgow patter,<br> a distinct dialect of the Scots language that is noted for being difficult
          to understand by those from outside the city.
           </br>  Glasgow grew from a small rural settlement on the River Clyde to become the largest seaport in Scotland,
           </br>and tenth largest by tonnage in Britain.</p>

          <p class="card-text">Newcastle upon Tyne is a university city on the River Tyne in northeast England.</br>
            With its twin city, Gateshead, it was a major shipbuilding and manufacturing hub 
            during the Industrial Revolution and is now a centre of business, arts and sciences.</br>
           Spanning the Tyne, modern Gateshead Millennium Bridge,
            noted for its unique tilting aperture, is a symbol of the 2 cities.</br>
            Newcastle upon Tyne – or simply 'Newcastle' as it is most commonly
            referred to – is one of the most iconic cities in Britain,
            famous for its industrial heritage, eponymous brown ale,</br>
            popular nightlife and distinct regional 'Geordie' dialect.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Sheffield</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Sheffield is a city in the English county of South Yorkshire.
            In the city centre, the Millennium Gallery shows metalwork and art</br> 
            from Sheffield and around the world. It adjoins the Winter Garden, 
            a large temperate glasshouse filled with plants.</br>
           Kelham Island Museum covers the city’s industrial heritage.
           The nearby countryside is part of Peak District National Park,</br>
            characterised by moorland and rocky ridges.
            Sheffield played a crucial role in the Industrial Revolution,
             with many significant inventions and technologies developed in the city. 
             In the 19th century, the city saw a huge expansion of its traditional cutlery trade,
              when stainless steel and crucible steel were developed locally,
               fuelling an almost tenfold increase in the population. 
               Sheffield received its municipal charter in 1843,
                becoming the City of Sheffield in 1893. International
                 competition in iron and steel caused a decline in these 
                 industries in the 1970s and 1980s,
             coinciding with the collapse of coal mining in the area.</p>
