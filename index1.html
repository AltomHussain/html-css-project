      <img src="https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02423/london_2423609b.jpg"> 
      <p>London is famous for more than its magnificent ancient buildings,</br> the Palace of Westminster, Trafalgar Square, 
           Tower of London, London Eye, Art Galleries, and Big Ben.
           As the capital of Britain,</br> London is well known for influencing other cities of the world since the Middle Ages. <br>
          The present-day City of London covers an area of 1.1 square miles (2.9 square km) at the heart of Greater London 
               and is a centre of world finance.</br> Greater London forms the core of a larger metropolitan area (with a proportionately</br> 
               larger population) that extends as far as 45 miles (70 km) from the centre.

        <p> Out of all of the cities in Europe,</br> Birmingham is the youngest with under 25s accounting 
            for nearly 40% of its population.
             Birmingham also holds the honours for having one of the highest graduate</br>

        <h2>Manchester</h2>
        <h3>this Manchester</h3>
        <img src="https://www.newcollegegroup.com/app/uploads/2018/08/shutterstock_512240539.jpg">
        <p>Manchester is a major city in the northwest </br>of England with a rich industrial heritage.  
            The Castlefield conservation area’s </br>18th-century canal system recalls the city’s days as a textile powerhouse, 
            and visitors can trace this history at the interactive Museum of Science & Industry.
             The revitalised Salford Quays</br> dockyards now house the Daniel Libeskind-designed 
            </br>Imperial War Museum North and the Lowry cultural centre.
            Manchester may be seen by many as being one of the most famous </br>
            football cities in the world, with it being the home to two of the biggest teams.

        <p>City status in the United Kingdom</p>
        <img src="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/galleries/517x/326114.jpg"/>
        <p>City status in the United Kingdom is granted by the monarch 
            <br>of the United Kingdom to a select group of communities: 
            as of 2014, there are 69 cities in the United Kingdom – 51 in England, six in Wales,</br>
             seven in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland. </b>
            The holding of city status gives a settlement no special rights.
                The Cambridge English Dictionary defines 'city' as 'a large town'
                     or 'any town in the UK which has a cathedral'.
                     List of localities in England by population sets out the population of localities, <br>
                     also called urban sub-divisions, as at the 2001 census (and thus significantly out of date). <br>
                     The Office for National Statistics changed its methodology significantly for the 2011 census and <br>
                     consequently this list cannot be updated and is retained for historical interest only. These localities 
                     <Br>were component areas of the urban areas of England as defined by the ONS and were intended to enable
                        <br> detailed study of smaller areas within urban areas, and to enable comparisons to be made with historical data. 
                        For example, in this list Manchester has a smaller population than the Greater Manchester Urban Area,
                         which includes towns such as Sale and Stockport. Some large settlements, such as Milton Keynes
                          (population 229,941 in 2011),
                      are not listed at all because the ONS data was recorded for their component districts and not summed.
                      London, first settled during the reign of the Roman Empire over what is now Britain,
                       is today the capital city of both England and the United Kingdom.
                        The city is the most populous city in the United Kingdom with a population of 8.6 million inhabitants who speak over 300 languages.
                         London is one of the leading global cities in art, entertainment, commerce, finance, fashion, media, and healthcare. 
                         The city is also one of the world’s leading financial centers and has the fifth largest metropolitan area GDP in the world.
                       London, which is home to four World Heritage Sites, is among the world's most visited cities.

            Glasgow is also known for the Glasgow patter,<br> a distinct dialect of the Scots language that is noted for being difficult
                 to understand by those from outside the city.
               </br>  Glasgow grew from a small rural settlement on the River Clyde to become the largest seaport in Scotland,
             </br>and tenth largest by tonnage in Britain.</p>
