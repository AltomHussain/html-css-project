            Tower of London, London Eye, Art Galleries, and Big Ben.
            As the capital of Britain,</br> London is well known for influencing other cities of the world since the Middle Ages. <br>
            The present-day City of London covers an area of 1.1 square miles (2.9 square km) at the heart of Greater London 
             and is a centre of world finance.</br> Greater London forms the core of a larger metropolitan area (with a proportionately</br> 
             larger population) that extends as far as 45 miles (70 km) from the centre.
